Implementation of a learning genetic algorithm, based on biological evolution.
The Prey objects must mutate to become faster and healthier, so they won't get
eaten. As the algorithm continues, the fit Prey breed with higher probability
than unfit Prey, theoretically creating fitter and fitter children.
